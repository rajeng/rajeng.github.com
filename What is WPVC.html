            <p>The term "wood plastics composites - WPCs" refers to a new range of materials that resemble wood. It combines the advantages of wood with those of plastics. There are three great attractions of wood plastics composite: </p>
 <p>
1. It can be extruded to make continuous profiles of any desired cross-section with great dimensional constancy and accuracy and very little waste, unlike real wood. WPC can also be injection moulded, and some development work has been done using rotational moulding.
 </p>
<p>
2. Outdoor maintenance requirements for wood plastics composites are very low, although it can be machined and worked in the same way as wood. Painting is not necessary but paint can be applied to WPC, if desired for aesthetic reasons, much more easily than to most plastics. Outdoor durability of WPC is better than that of softwood, and lifetimes of 25 to 30 years are expected.</p>
 <p>
3. WPC possesses some important environmental advantages that make it attractive to those who have opposed the use of PVC in building.
Technological advances now allow very high quality wood plastics composites to be made from waste wood and a resin binder. The waste wood comes from felled or damaged trees and from conventional woodworking operations, while the resin is often recycled material.</p>
